## 🚀 About the experience

I learned how important class names and indentation are for efficient styling.  
Despite never having used a framework, I began to wonder why it is important for a more fluid development.  
But I dont't learning about the framework yet and continue practicing just with html and css.  
  
I participated in this challenge to practice html and css, getting a simple javascript menu to work was a surprise even for me.  
  
realized that I must bring my javascript knowledge to the same level as my html and css. This may be what I need to finish this challenge.

## 📋 Notes

some parts of the project are not finished yet.  
  
form validation is not working because I haven't learned about this topic yet.

## 🛠️ How it was developed  

Participants were free to use the tool (frameworks) of their choice to develop the project.  
I developed without any framework. My focus was to put into practice what I had been studying over time and confirm that I was learning.  
I tried to structure each html page separately. Using the same css pattern for the footer and header, becasuse they are same components, shared between pages.  
The help of other Alura students was essential for me to be able to develop this project. We have a community that supports each other and that support is what has helped me to keep trying.

## 🖇️ Collaboration

This is a project for personal education.  
If you want to collaborate, get in touch, pointing out any errors or improvements,  
that would be of great help, for my learning.
